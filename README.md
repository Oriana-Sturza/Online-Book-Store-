PROJECT OVERVIEW:

I created a relational database called OnlineBookstoreDB for an online bookstore, covering all essential aspects of database management: schema design, data population, querying, and data modification.
What I Achieved:
Database Schema Design:
I carefully designed tables for Authors, Books, Customers, Orders, and OrderDetails, ensuring each table had appropriate primary keys and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.

Data Population:
I populated the database with sample data to simulate real-world scenarios. This included inserting authors, books with details like genre and price, customers with their contact information, and orders along with order details (which books were purchased in each order).

Data Querying:
I wrote SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the database:
Listing Books with Authors: Showing details of books along with their respective authors.
Customer Orders: Listing customers with their total orders and total amount spent.
Top Selling Books: Identifying the most popular books based on sales.
Additional Queries: Including detailed queries like listing orders with customer details, revenue generated per author, top spending customers, average book prices per genre, and identifying books that haven't been ordered yet.

Data Modification:
I demonstrated CRUD operations:
Updating Book Price: Adjusting the price of a specific book.
Deleting Customer: Removing a customer from the database, along with all associated orders.


My Problem-Solving Approach:

Structured Schema Design:
I began by defining entities (Authors, Books, Customers, Orders, OrderDetails) and their attributes, ensuring each table's structure was optimal for storing relevant data.

Thorough Data Insertion:
I meticulously inserted sample data to populate the database realistically, allowing for comprehensive testing and validation of queries against various data scenarios.

Effective Data Querying:
My queries were designed to retrieve specific information such as book details, customer orders, sales analytics, and more, tailored to address practical business questions.

Comprehensive Data Management:
I showcased proficiency in data management by updating book prices and efficiently deleting customer records along with their associated orders, maintaining database integrity throughout.

Analytical Insight Development:
I incorporated analytical queries to derive actionable insights, such as calculating revenue per author, identifying top customers by spending, and determining average book prices per genre, supporting informed decision-making.

Conclusion:
Through a methodical approach to database management, I successfully created a functional online bookstore database that not only meets operational needs but also provides valuable insights into business performance. This project highlighted my ability to handle complex data structures, query optimization, and strategic data analysis within a specific domain context, showcasing my skills in database design and management.
